# Talking-Clock-Team-5

## Project description
This is an interactive speaking/talking clock that we developed in Python 3.9 for an assignment for the course "Introduction to Voice Technology" & "Programming" as part of the Voice Technology MSc at RUG - Campus Fryslan.

## Requirements before installing
Make sure you have `Python 3` installed.  
If not, please download the latest 3.12.0 version from here:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installation Instructions

##  Licensing and FAIR Data Principles
The audio files used were generated using TTS APIs.

No consent forms were required for the collection of this data since there were no individuals recorded by us to generate this speech. The data used for the speaking clock therefore complies with GDPR regulations.
